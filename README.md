# DAO-Times
A multi-chain digital media minting press operated by a DAO with tokenomics to make quality contributions the primary way governance tokens are earned. The goal is to create digital press that is able to fund itself(a digital news stand, minting new issues and maintaining URLs for released NFT content) and a DAO comprised of those who contribute and develop the DAO Times and protect the community's voice from censorship or allowing a finacial investor to steal the benifits earned by content contributors.
